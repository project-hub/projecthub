## Project Hub

Project Hub is a web application designed for small business to connect with talent that they need for short-term or long-term projects. The goal is for the employer and the potential employee to build a professional working relationship that both would benefit from by growing the business and allowing the employee to gain experience and referrals to other small business. 

Although the initial development of the project is focused on connecting employers with developers the application could very easily be applied to any business with any temporary or permanent staffing needs. It could easily be implemented on a business website allowing the business to have a pool of potential employees. Additional features can also be added. 

Front end design uses HTML, CSS, Twitter Bootstrap, jQuery and Javascript. 
Back end development uses the Larvel PHP Framework, mySQL(Database), Amazon s3 Cloud Service for file upload and download and Social Authentication using GitHub Oauth.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).

### License

The Laravel framework is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Amazon S3 

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the Internet. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web. You can accomplish these tasks using the simple and intuitive web interface of the AWS Management Console. More information can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/).

## GitHub OAuth 

OAuth2 is a protocol that lets external applications request authorization to private details in a user's GitHub account without getting their password. This is preferred over Basic Authentication because tokens can be limited to specific types of data, and can be revoked by users at any time. More information can be found [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/).
